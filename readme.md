# CLOSURE, ARROW FUNCTIONS AND REST PARAMETERS

This is a Javascript example that takes the NAMES and RESULTS of 3 students and assesses their exam results and prints out a message for each student.

I've added extensive comments above each line or block of code that gives examples of these topics:

SEE MAIN.JS FILE

- CLOSURE - An example of calling an inner function later on of an assigned function variable. 
- ARROW FUNCTIONS - A few examples of how arrow functions can replace the standard way of writing functions.
- TEMPLATE STRINGS - An example of how to output multiple strings in Javascript in a more concise and easier to read way similar to printf() in PHP or String.Format() in C#.
- REST PARAMATERS - An example of how to create a function that can take in any number of parameters.
